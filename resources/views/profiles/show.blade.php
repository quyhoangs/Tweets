           <p class="text-sm mt-2">Hello, my name is Matt Lemanski. I am the creator of Speaking of English,
              a blog for intermediate English learners who want to become more fluent in the language.
              I am originally from the United States and I currently live in Germany.
               I have been a teacher since 2008, and specialize in business writing and IELTS preparation. Before becoming a teacher, 
               I worked as a copyeditor for government agencies in Washington DC and as a ghostwriter for startup founders and independent 
               consultants around the world. In my free time, I enjoy hiking, practicing photography, and exploring the city by bike.</p>
